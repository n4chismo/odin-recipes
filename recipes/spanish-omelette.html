                <h3>Steps: </h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>Place the diced potatoes in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium and simmer for 5 minutes until potatoes are barely tender. Drain and set aside.</li>
                    <li>In a 9-inch non-stick skillet, heat 2 tbsp olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onions and sauté for 5 minutes until translucent.</li>
                    <li>Add the par-boiled potato cubes and smoked paprika. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are lightly browned. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>In a medium bowl, beat the 6 eggs until blended. Pour over the potato-onion mixture and let sit for 1 minute to set the bottom.</li>
                    <li>As the edges set, use a spatula to gently pull them toward the center, tilting the pan to allow the uncooked egg to flow to the edges.</li>
                    <li>When the omelette is mostly set but still a little runny on top, remove from heat. Cover with a plate and carefully invert to release the omelette onto the plate.</li>
                    <li>Slide the omelette back into the skillet using remaining 2 tbsp olive oil. Cook for 2 more minutes.</li>
                    <li>Slide the Spanish Tortilla onto a plate and garnish with chopped parsley if desired. Allow to cool slightly before slicing into wedges.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Serve the robust, potato-packed Spanish Omelette warm or at room temp with bread, salad or your favorite tapas! It's an easy, portable meal.</p>
