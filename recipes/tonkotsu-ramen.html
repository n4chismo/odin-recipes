            <h2>Description: </h2>

            <p>Prepare to be enveloped in an umami-laced embrace with each transcendent slurp of velvety Tonkotsu Ramen. This Japanese soul food starts with an oh-so-sumptuous 18-hour pork bone broth - a golden elixir simmered to perfection until it attains a depth of flavor so profoundly satisfying, it could make angels weep. Luxuriously coating each tangle of chewy ramen noodles, the creamy, opaque broth seduces the senses with layers of porky indulgence. Adorned with tender slices of simmered pork belly, jammy soft-boiled egg, shredded nori, and shishito peppers, this ramen is an intricate tapestry of textures and flavors that dances across the palate. Tonkotsu is pure comfort in a bowl - an edible hug that instantly transports you to the best ramen-ya in Japan. Slurp responsibly, my friends.</p>

                <li>6-inch piece ginger, sliced</li>
                <li>1 bundle scallions, cleaned</li>
                <li>2 tbsp salt</li>
                <li>Ramen noodles</li>
                <li>Sliced pork belly or tenderloin</li>
                <li>Soft boiled eggs</li>

            <h3>Steps: </h3>

            <h4>For the Broth... </h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large pot, cover pork bones with cold water. Bring to a boil and discard water to blanch bones. Rinse pot.</li>
                <li>Return bones to pot and cover with 1 gallon of fresh cold water. Add onions, garlic, ginger and scallions.</li>
                <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low simmer. Skim any scum that rises to the surface.</li>
                <li>Simmer gently for 16-18 hours, adding more water as needed to keep bones covered.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and strain broth through a fine mesh sieve. Discard solids.</li>
                <li>Skim off any excess fat from the surface of the broth. Season with salt.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>To Assemble... </h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook ramen noodles according to package instructions until chewy.</li>
                <li>Warm individual serving bowls and add cooked noodles.</li>
                <li>Top with sliced pork belly or tenderloin.</li>
                <li>Ladle very hot tonkotsu broth over the top.</li>
                <li>Garnish with soft boiled egg, nori sheet, shishito peppers or scallions.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The key is slowly simmering the pork bones for 16-18 hours to extract every ounce of collagen and gelatin, creating an lusciously viscous, milky broth. This ramen takes time but is so worth it!</p>
