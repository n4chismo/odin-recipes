                <li>1 onion, diced</li>
                <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
                <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
                <li>3 tbsp all-purpose flour/li>
                <li>2 cups chicken or vegetable broth/li>
                <li>1 cup sour cream</li>

                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps: </h3>

            <ol>
                <li>In a skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the sliced mushrooms and sauté for 5 minutes until they start to brown.</li>
                <li>Add the diced onions and cook for 2 more minutes until translucent. Then add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the flour over the mushroom mixture and stir to coat everything evenly. Cook for 2 minutes to cook out the raw flour taste.</li>
                <li>Gradually whisk in the broth and bring to a simmer. Let simmer for 5-7 minutes, stirring frequently, until the sauce thickens to your desired consistency.</li>
                <li>Remove sauce from heat and stir in the sour cream until fully incorporated and smooth.</li>
                <li>Stir in the chopped fresh dill and season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Serve the mushroom sauce warm over meat, potatoes, pasta, or vegetables. Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The roux helps create a velvety, thick mushroom gravy that is so satisfying.</p>
